Sunlight increases serotonin, boosting mood and calmness. It also aligns sleep-wake cycles for better rest and refreshment. As a key player in vitamin D production, sunlight supports brain health and maintains high energy levels. Additionally, exposure to natural light sharpens focus and enhances cognitive function, helping you think more clearly and perform better. Embrace natural light to uplift your mental health!")
